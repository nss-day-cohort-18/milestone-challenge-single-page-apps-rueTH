From the tell-tale signs of cigarette burns (college, circa 2011), to the familiar sundried dash, forever destined to remain the color of her owner's foundation (AOII pledge year, circa 2009), as well as the effectively permanant fixtures of strangely located PSLatte stains, you will inevitably find yourself distracted from your sociological observation and immersed in the nostalgia of what life was like before you had your shit together. Please note: This item is available for trade only. Please see pricing for more information. "
